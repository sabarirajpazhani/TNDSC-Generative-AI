Face detection using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a computer technology that uses deep learning to identify faces in an image. CNNs process data through multiple layers of arrays and are well-suited for image recognition. For example, after receiving an image as input, the network outputs a set of values that indicate the attributes of faces or facial features at various points in the image.
